Figure code for Kim et al 2023, Cell Reports: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2022.111978

The original Zenodo VOR release (Dec 7th, 2022) can be found here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7408025

Due to Github file size limitations, the full set of data files can now be found at the corresponding Figshare dataset: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27237114

Analysis scripts and annotations are identical between the Figshare and Github/Zenodo versions - the only differences are the extra addition of intermediate analysis files (mainly R data files), which may be of some convenience.
